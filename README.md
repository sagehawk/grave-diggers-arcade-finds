## ‚ú® Core Features

-   **üîç Intelligent Search & Filtering:** A powerful and intuitive filtering system that allows users to sort games by genre, platform, release date, and more.
-   **‚ôæÔ∏è Performant Infinite Scrolling:** Seamlessly load more games as the user scrolls, providing a smooth and endless discovery experience.
-   **üîê User Authentication:** Secure user sign-up and login functionality powered by Supabase Auth.
-   **üé® Custom Component Library:** Built with a focus on accessibility and reusability, ensuring a consistent and high-quality UI.
-   **üì± Fully Responsive Design:** A pixel-perfect, mobile-first design that works flawlessly on any device, from phones to desktops.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

This project was built from the ground up to showcase a modern, full-stack development workflow.

-   **Frontend:**
    -   **Framework:** React (with Vite for a fast development experience)
    -   **Language:** TypeScript for type safety and scalability
    -   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for a utility-first, responsive design
    -   **State Management:** React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`)
-   **Backend (BaaS):**
    -   **Platform:** Supabase
    -   **Database:** PostgreSQL for storing game and user data
    -   **Authentication:** Supabase Auth for managing user accounts and sessions
-   **Deployment:** Vercel

## üß† Key Technical Decisions & Highlights

-   **Optimistic UI for Filtering:** To create a snappy user experience, filters are applied to the currently displayed data on the client-side first, while a new request is sent to the backend. This makes the UI feel instantaneous.
-   **Efficient Data Fetching:** Implemented debouncing on the search input to prevent excessive API calls while the user is typing, improving performance and reducing backend load.
-   **Custom Hooks for Reusability:** Abstracted complex logic (like data fetching and authentication status) into custom React hooks (`useGames`, `useAuth`) to keep components clean and maintainable.
